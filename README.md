# Clojure implementation of word2vec

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tamamu/word2vec-clojure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tamamu/word2vec-clojure)

WIP

It's using the [implementation of tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.9/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py#link2keyword=word2vec_basic.py) as reference.

- [x] Download the data.
- [x] Build the dictionary and replace rare words with UNK token.
- [x] Function to generate a training batch for the skip-gram model.
- [ ] Build and train a skip-gram model.
- [ ] Begin training.
- [ ] Visualize the embeddings.

## Log

06/29
I try to use "neanderthal", but my PC can't build atlas-lapack.
If I can disable CPU throttling, the build wlii be successful.

06/30
Use core.matrix for alternative to neanderthal.

07/01
I'm writing generate-batch function now.
Almost finished but the result is strange...x-(
Try to fix.

07/05
I got it. I forgot that the buffer was a deque!
Since the implementation of deque was missing, I implemented a deque instantly.
As a result, I could get almost correct output.
